Code Completion
===============

While using O-MVLL, it can be handy to have code completion. For this purpose,
the package ``omvll`` is available on PyPI and can be installed with pip:

.. code-block:: console

   $ python -m pip install [--user] omvll

.. note::
  The ``omvll``  package is just exposing Python typing objects and does not contain
  the obfuscation logic.
